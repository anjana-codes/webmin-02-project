## Copy and clone base repository 

1. Copy the base repository into your GitHub account by selecting the "Use this Template" button on GitHub and specifying yourself as the owner.

to an external site.

2. On your machine, clone YOUR new repo down to your machine.

## Export to HTML
Export Using Jupyter Menu

Use the Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab interface menu:

Try: File -> Save and Export As... -> HTML (It was not avaiable in file options, so I used three dotted line (...)near outliner and export as HTML.)

git push origin main
